### Goal
You are given an institutional statement. Your task is to classify it either as **constitutive** or **regulative** based on the IG 2.0 framework.

### Guidelines
Does the statement introduce or parameterize fundamental aspects of the action situation (boundaries, definition or modification of actors,
actions, objects, artifacts and associated affordances; endowment of rights or authority/power)?
- In doing so, does the statement define positioning and constellation of entities in an institutional setting in which potentially regulated behavior is enacted?
- If so, the statement is constitutive in kind.

Does the statement signal unambiguously implied or explicit agency, while specifying duty and discretion, or sanctions for transgression?
- In doing so, does the statement draw on (i.e., makes implicit or explicit reference to) actors, objects or artifacts, including a potential modification of the institutional setting as an outcome of actors exercising activities regulated as part of the institutional statement?
- If so, the statement is regulative in kind.
