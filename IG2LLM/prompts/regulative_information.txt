A statement is regulative if and only if it contains:
- **Attribute (A)**: the actor expected to carry out the action
- **Aim (I)**: the institutionally regulated action
- **Context**: at least one of the following must be present:
  - **Cac (Activation Condition)**
  - **Cex (Execution Constraint)**

If no context is explicitly provided, the statement is still considered regulative by default interpretation: "under all conditions" and "no execution constraints." However, **do not extract** default interpretations as components. Only include Cac or Cex if they are explicitly expressed in the statement.

All other components are optional but should be extracted if they are explicitly present.
